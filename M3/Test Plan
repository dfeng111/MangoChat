Our test plan will be to unit test, integration test, system test and acceptance test.
In our pull requests unit testing will be included. We will run regression testing.
For unit testing we will test the smallest piece of code(function or method) in the application.
For integration testing individual software modules will be combined then tested as a group.
For system testing it will be tested when our system is complete in order to evaluate it.
For acceptance testing we will check for flaws and confirm that our system meets its requirements.
We will run regression testing to ensure that after every change there are no unintended breaks.
