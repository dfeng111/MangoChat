## Testing Strategy and Updates: 

 

The approaches we have done are writing test files then running them. To improve our testing, we can keep looking at the coverage. We will also use pytest fixtures which will help us improve our tests. Tests have been created using the source code. We have tested our python code such as deleting messages and blocking users. These are working and passing along with some other files. The file leave-join-channel is not working as the tests have failed and we are working as a group to figure out why. 

 

## Automation: 

 

The first type of automation that we have implemented is pytest which allows us to test all our files to see if they work.  It is run with a single command and tests every file.  It also runs every time someone pushes commits to GitHub.  This automation allows individuals in the group to be warned when code has been broken, before the situation gets out of hand.  By implementing this we have been able to keep the code relatively clean as the project approaches completion.  We have also implemented the Observer Pattern for message sending and receiving.  This ensures that all users who are members of a particular channel will receive a message when it is sent. 

 

 

## Summary: 

We have completed the login/register page, friends page and a user page all with some functionality. These were created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Other pages have also been created using Python such as messaging, blocking user, deleting messages, add/remove friends, etc. Test files were also created for these which were ran and the tests passed. Currently in the project we are doing well as we are completing 10 issues a week, and everything is functioning as intended.   

The process that we selected as team is overall well. We try to stay on top of the issues and always review each other's code thoroughly. Everyone creates tests for their source code and creates branches when working on a new issue. Something that could change is completing our scrum meetings before our scheduled lab time.  

The quality of our source code is pretty good because we create tests for our code and before merging the code one or two people check to see if the tests pass and that the code is error free and efficient.
